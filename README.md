# hpfem-2dscatter

This is a simple 2D finite element electromagnetic scattering program that employs a hp-finite element discretisation for the
solution of the curl curl vector wave equation. Discretisations consisting of triangular or quadrilateral meshes are possible
with elements of arbitrary order. Program currently setup for purely triangular meshes for simplicity.

The program has been developed as a MATLAB teaching tool to allow students to play with different types of discretisations
and to experiment with h and p refinements for problems with smooth solutions and for problems with singularities associated
with edges and corners. A perfectly matched layer (PML) approach is used to truncate the otherwise unbounded domain. A number
of benchmark problems are included, and the program computes the radar cross section (per unit length) and contours of the
scattered field. 

The hierarchic H(curl) conforming finite element basis functions are based on those proposed in

For triangular meshes the code calls the Mesh2d matlab mesh generation tool that has been developed by D. Engwirda
